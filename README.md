# Bento Grid UI

This project is a fully responsive **Bento Grid layout** built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It showcases a modern, clean design based on multiple card components arranged in a grid, similar to UI trends used in dashboards and SaaS landing pages.

## 📌 Overview

The layout displays different feature cards such as:

-   Create & schedule posts
-   AI‑powered content creation
-   Social media reviews
-   Consistent posting tools
-   Multi‑platform management
-   Audience and followers growth

Each card uses custom styling, spacing, and grid placement to recreate a polished UI component system.
